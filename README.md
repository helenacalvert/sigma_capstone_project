Welcome to my Hangman game!

My project simulates a hangman game using python. 
By running the code, the user is asked to guess a letter after being given underscores for the number of letters in the word that is randomly chosen from a list of words.
You have 6 lives, and you can see how the hangman drawing progresses after each life.
If you run out of lives, the hangman is drawn.
You can guess individual letters, each incorrect letter costs a life.
You can also guess words if you think you know it for an immediate win. However if you guess incorrectly, this will cost a life without giving extra info about the letters in the word.
If you guess a letter that has already been picked, it will not count as a life and you will be reminded of the guesses you have already made.

Enjoy!
